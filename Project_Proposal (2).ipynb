    "\n",
    "1. **Opening Used**\n",
    "   - Create graph displaying opening win percentages.\n",
    "   - Recommend best openings for different game tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Playstyle**\n",
    "   - Discover which is better between aggressive and positional playstyle.\n",
    "   - Make graph displaying the best playstyle for every rating.\n",
    "   - Identify when specific playstyles are superior depending on game conditions.\n",
    "   - Determine aggressive tendencies through factors like early pawn advancement, piece sacrifices, opening used, and length of game. \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Most Frequently Used Tactics**\n",
    "   - Look at common tactics so that a chess player would know which ones to study more of. \n",
    "   - Analyze correlations between ratings and the use of particular tactics.\n",

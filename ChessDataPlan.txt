    "Chess is a global strategy game played by all, from children to the elderly, with countless openings, tactics, and playstyles that all influence the outcome of the match. Many dedicated chess players hone in on these aspects while reviewing past games or studying the professionals in search of improvement. However, what if the strategies employed are not the best fit for a given rank and/or playstyle? With the wealth of data available by APIs such as Lichess and Stockfish API, this project seeks to understand the effectiveness of various openings, playstyles (such as aggressive vs. passive), and common tactics at various ranks to provide users of all skill levels with applicable information to help improve their game. Additionally, with the rise of chess.com, chess can be played online with players being matched to those of similar ranking; however, not every match will be evenly set resulting in a potential skill advantage to the higher-ranked player. This study aims to explore 2 key questions:\n",
    "1. Which chess openings and playstyles lead to higher win percentages across different rank levels?\n",
    "2. How does the rating differential impact the outcome of a match?\n",

    "Positive rating_diff values indicate the player with higher rating won while negative rating_diff values indicate the player with the lower rating won or the match resulted in a draw. The histograms resemble normal distribution but are shifted more towards the positive rating differentials suggesting the higher rated player tends to win more. Conclusions for games with average ratings below 1200 cannot be made due to the low number of games in the data. "
